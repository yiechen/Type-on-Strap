I am a full-time economist working with Renewable Energy Project Finance at The Brazilian Development Bank - BNDES - at Rio de Janeiro. I am interested in how infrastructure interacts with the society, nature and institutions, and in problem solving. My work utilizes financial analysis techniques, such as DCF and FCF/FCFF, to understand the feasibility of any given financial model. I am also interested in urbanism and demography, such as how cities fail to provide for their citizens and what should be planned or have been done. I enjoy visualizing and analyzing data, learning programming, and watching sports.
