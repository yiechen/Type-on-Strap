I try writing <strong>useful & reusable tools</strong> to help me and hopefully others &mdash; check out by searching for the tag: <a href="/projects">projects</a>. In past I've become an moderately-experienced R useR and an enthusiast in R-Shiny and RMarkdown. Nowadays I'm dabbling with Python and in the future i expect to be able to make D3 visualizations.

The <strong><a href="/projects">projects</a></strong> page is a nice place to see some of my work. Actually, it will be... I am still working on it! For now, look out for the projects tag ;)

<p class="about-text">
Nowadays I work with renewable energy projects. I won't be posting about work.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
In my spare time I enjoy visualizing and analyzing data, learning photography and film-editing skills, and tracking/watching sports.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
This blog serves mainly as a resource to myself (so I can refer to how I did something), but it also should be able to help others. Here I will also try to showcase some of my photography works and share some sort of travel journals and plans. Finally, there will be posts of whatever I find interesting (obviously!!!). And eventually some rants, though I will keep it to a minimum because we have to hustle...
