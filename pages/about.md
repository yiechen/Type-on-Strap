![My helpful self]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnails/yiechen-circle-resized.jpg" | absolute_url }})

I work as a full-time economist. There I am interested in how renewable energy projects interact with its surrounding landscape and communities. I am also interested in the future of the cities, such as how cities should develop and grow.

In my spare time I enjoy visualizing and analyzing data, learning photography skills, and watching sports.
