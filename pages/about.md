<p class="about-text">
Nowadays I am attached to renewable energy projects. I also have a professional interest in demographic and social-communication dynamics.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
Also in my spare time I enjoy visualizing and analyzing data, learning photography and film-editing skills, and tracking/watching sports.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
This blog serves mainly as a resource to myself (so I can refer to how I did something), but also aims to help others. Here I will also showcase some of my photography works and sort of travel journals and plans. Finally, there will be posts of whatever I find interesting to share (obviously!!!). And eventually some rants, though I will keep it to a minimum because we have to hustle...
