I am a full-time economist working at The Brazilian Development Bank. I am interested in how infrastructure interacts with the society, nature and institutions, and in problem solving. I am also interested in urbanism and demography, such as how cities fail to provide for their citizens and what should be planned or have been done. I enjoy visualizing and analyzing data, learning programming, and watching sports.
