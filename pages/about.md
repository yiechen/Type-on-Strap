Nowadays I am attached to renewable energy projects and I am interested in how they interact with their surrounding landscape and communities. I am also interested in the future of the cities, such as how cities should develop and grow.

Also in my spare time I enjoy visualizing and analyzing data, learning photography skills, and tracking sports.

This blog serves mainly as a resource to myself (so I can refer to how I did something), but also aims to help others. Here I will also showcase some of my photography works and sort of travel journals and plans. Finally, there will be posts of whatever I find interesting to share (obviously!!!). And eventually some rants, though I will keep it to a minimum because we have to hustle...
