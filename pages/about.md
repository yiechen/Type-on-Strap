I work as a full-time economist. There I am interested in how renewable energy projects interact with its surrounding landscape and communities. I am also interested in the future of the cities, such as how cities should develop and grow.

In my spare time I enjoy visualizing and analyzing data, learning photography skills, and watching sports.

This blog serves mainly as a resource to myself (so I can refer to how I did something), but also aims to teach others. Here I will also showcase some of my photography works and some kind of travel journals and plans. Finally, I will eventually post whatever contents that keep me motivate. And some rants, though I will keep it to as few as possible because:
