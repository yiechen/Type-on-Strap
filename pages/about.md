![My helpful self]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnails/yiechen-circle-resized.jpg" | absolute_url }})

I work as a full-time economist at The Brazilian Development Bank. Nowadays I am attached to renewable energy projects and I am interested in how they interact with its surrounding landscape and communities. I am also interested in the future of the cities, such as how cities should develop and grow.

In my spare time I enjoy visualizing and analyzing data, learning photography skills, and watching sports.

This blog serves mainly as a resource to myself (so I can refer to how I did something), but also aims to help others. Here I will also showcase some of my photography works and sort of travel journals and plans. Finally,there will be posts of whatever I find interesting to share. And eventually some rants, though I will keep it to a minimum because we need to hustle.
