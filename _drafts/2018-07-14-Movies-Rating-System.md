Everybody should have your own rating system as you watch a film or read a book. It should help you focus on the most important features and identify its weaknesses however greatness it may possess. Here is how I rate the movies and series I have watched.

## The SIREN System

### Star / Storytelling

Star factor or cast ensemble + crush?

### Inspiration / Ingenuity

Plot twist or concept is original

### Replayability / Readability

Is it re-watchable?

### Entertainment

Does it entertain, aka is the plot enjoyable?

### Notability

Instant classic or cultural reference?

## The 10-10 System

### Running time

Is the movie way too long or too short? Does it feel botched and makes you check the clock too see how much more it may take to end? Does it make you feel disinterested mid-way? Does it feel like the end or parts were rushed? Could it have a few more minutes or a few less?

### The Cast

The quality of the cast. You may call it stardom factor, or simply if the cast has a good profile of good acting. A cast full of great role-players may trumph a cast with two super-stars but terrible role-players.

### Performance

The cast performance in-scene. Was the acting believable? Was there any chemistry between the characters where it should be?

### Direction

The directing style and artistic view of the play. Simply the editing of the film and itÂ´s photography.

### Story

The plot. Is it interesting? Is the subject original? Are there plot holes or deus ex-machina events?

### Script

The story-telling, quality of dialogue and pacing of events.

### Creativity

Are there plot twists? Does it take a creative way to do usual stuff?

### Soundtrack

It says all... How does the soundscore work for the movie? Does it add or subtracts? Does it disturb or is inappropriate?

### Job Description

The real or fictional job of characters are depicted truthfully or are plausible with reality? Does it make a connection with the real conditions and ways of real workers?

### The Extra Bonus Point

Intangibles?
