Everybody should have your own rating system as you watch a film or read a book. It should help you focus on the most important features and identify its weaknesses however greatness it may possess. Here is how I rate the movies and series I have watched.

To be straight, I don´t actually use a single rating system, but I actually do use two systems in tandem. The first one is a more straight-forward filter system, which I named the SIREN rating. The second one is a more detailed review and focuses on artistical and technical aspects as well as some entertainment factors. I will explain them separately as follows...

## The SIREN System

The SIREN ratings was designed to have a "make it or break it" evaluation of five entertainment aspects of a film or movie series. For each category I rate if the movie "passes or fails" to satisfy myself. That was an effort to surpass the volatility of any rating system that grades from 1 to 10 or A to F and that subsequently are subject to recency bias and among other cons. Those usual rating systems make it harder to compare films that were watched far apart as some criteria may have changed inbetween. So, for example, a 4 star picture I rated today may not have been graded as a 4-star two years ago.

I also made this system in a way as to help me select what would be worthwhile to keep and what could be purged from my HD's. So the criteria were chosen with that purpose in mind. Finally, I adapted 3 criteria so this method could also be used for books. So let´s look at each of them:

### Star power (books: Storytelling)

Known as the *Star factor*, here I acknowledge that a specific actor/actress or cast ensemble is a driving force to why I watched it and also why I should keep it. Great acting, charisma or simply a personnal crush on a specific actor is considered, and if it is memorable enough it gets a major **S**, otherwise it keeps a *s*.

### Inspiration (books: Ingenuity)

AKA the "creativity factor". Here I value strongly a good plot twist or if the concept of the script, photography or mythology is original and aspiring. Thought-provoking dialogues and themes are highly praised and valued.

### Replayability (books: Readability)

"Is it worth to re-watch?" The answer to this question should be enough. If it seems that once watched I would not feel atracted to espontaneously see said movie or even a hint of doubt must mean it fails this criteria.

### Entertainment

"Does it entertain, was it enjoyable?" This one is a very subjective one, but it must be easy to rate for polar opposites. For great movies it may have a well-deserved and easy pass and for terrible ones a strong failing mark. For mildly entertaining movies it may be considered in tandem with the replayability as it may shed some light on how the grade may survive the test of time. Usually a film that fails the replayability test also should fail this one, so we should not be generous with one trick ponnies.

### Notability / Noteworthiness (*cringe*)

Renowned classic films which are celebrated by their outstanding contribution and as cultural reference of their time or a portrayed era should get an automatic pass. Recent films that are expected to become classics are also for a strong consideration. Films that are infamously hyped should be rated at discretion. (As a **last resort**, if you want to give an extra point to some movie that would not pass this criteria, it may serve as a bonus.) 

### Example of use

Sabrina (1954) would receive a **SIREN** rating, ie., a maximum grade at each criteria, as it has Audrey Hepburn as a **S**tar, **I**nspires for the good script and story-telling and mild social critique, is pleasant to **R**ewatch, is positively **E**nterntaining and is widely k**N**own as a classic film.

Solaris (2002) remake by Steven Sodenberg would receive a **sIren** rating, and that's mostly because the story is proven to be much more promising considering that the previous adaption of Stanislaw Lem's novel by Tarkovsky in 1972 did better.

Parent Trap (1998) starred by Lindsay Lohan is a guilty pleasure and scores a **SiREN** rating which may seem quite high for a film of low artistic/technical values. Although it is a cultural reference for it's slapstick comedy, the cuteness of a promissing child-actor turned troubled (young) adult, family oriented entertainment and romantic endevour, some may notice it's photography as uninspiring, poor film-edition and goofy acting for most of the cast. Even if it would score low in a technical review, it should be graded high for safekeeping purposes and for emotional appeal. Yes, it reminds my youth and I am delighted to watch it some saturday afternoons every other year (or when Li-Lo is on the news again...). 

## The 10-10 System

### Running time (E)

Is the movie way too long or too short? Does it feel botched and makes you check the clock too see how much more it may take to end? Does it make you feel disinterested mid-way? Does it feel like the end or parts were rushed? Could it have a few more minutes or a few less?

### The Cast (E)

The quality of the cast. You may call it stardom factor, or simply if the cast has a good profile of good acting. A cast full of great role-players may trumph a cast with two super-stars but terrible role-players.

### Performance (T)

The cast performance in-scene. Was the acting believable? Was there any chemistry between the characters where it should be?

### Direction (T)

The directing style and artistic view of the play.  A film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the screenplay (or script) while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Based on the editing of the film and it´s cinematography, managing the assets (getting inspired performances from the cast and crew). The cinematography is evaluated by the technical aspects of the images (lighting, lens choices, composition, exposure, filtration, film selection), to evaluate the artistic aesthetics that are supporting the director's vision of the story being told.

### Screenplay (T)

The story and the script. Is it interesting? Is the subject original? Are there plot holes or deus ex-machina events?

### Film Editing (T)

The story-telling, quality of dialogues and scenes, and the pacing of events. Would it be better if we cut some scenes or if we changed the order of them? Are there plot twists? Does it take a creative way to do usual stuff? Does it creatively work with the layers of images, story, dialogue, music, pacing, as well as the actors' performances to effectively "re-imagine" and even rewrite the film to craft a cohesive whole?

### Visual Production & Design (E/T)

Evaluates the visual appearance and how it communicates visually, stimulates moods, contrasts features, and psychologically appeals to a target audience. About visual elements used, what artistic style to use, and when to use motion. The richness of locations, interiors, make-up, hairstyling , costumes and special effects (CGI).

### Sound (score/track/editing) (T/E)

It should say all... How does the soundscore work for the movie? Does it add or subtracts? Does it disturb or is inappropriate? How does the tracks/songs affect mood and integrate the visual and acting elements?

### Job Description (T/E)

The real or fictional job of characters are depicted truthfully or are plausible with reality? Does it make a connection with the real conditions and ways of real workers?

### The Extra Bonus Point (T/E)

Intangibles? Creativity?
