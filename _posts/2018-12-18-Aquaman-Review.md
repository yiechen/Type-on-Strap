Here is my first impressions and review of Aquaman(2018).

<!--more-->

##### Main Cast: 9

Jason Momoa and Amber Heard were convincing in their roles and the relationship was credible. 
Maybe in a more serious settings they could perform better but it's not the kind of script that would need for them to be more engaged. That's why they could not be awarded the full score.

##### Supporting cast: 9
The veterans Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe won't ever compromise at this stage of their careers, but there were times when they seemed to be on autopilot or their "cries" were just way too familiar to the eyes and ears.
Patrick Wilson was pleasing as the main antagonist, but the role was not made for a actor to shine and take the limelight from the main character.
The other supporting actors were forgetable at most.

##### Screenplay: 8


##### Story: 8


##### Visuals
Cinematography: 9


Visual Effects: 10


Costume, makeup and design: 9


##### Audio
Music and score: 9


Sound editing, mixing and effects: 9


##### Film Editing: 9
While some sections of the film were unnecessary and felt like a Tourism Ad for Sicily and the Saharan Desert, for example. I could catch some sense on them for the small parts where there was some character building and need for some background for the couple's chemistry. I could see the critic that the chemistry between the two main characters would be seriously rushed and underdeveloped with the exclusion of such parts. So, treasure hunting aside, .... it did not feel bloated while some action scenes felt a bit confusing and too long, it can be considered that it was necessary for the main audience

##### Direction: 9


##### Artistic Value: 6


##### Entertainment Value: 10


##### Extra: Blechdel and Reverse-Blechdel test: 2

#### Conclusions

Final Score: [9 + 9 + 8 + 8 + (9 + 10 + 9)/3 + (9 + 9)/2 + 9 + 9 + 6 + 10]/10 = **8.634**
