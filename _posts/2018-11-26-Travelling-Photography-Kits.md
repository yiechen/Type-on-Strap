Not all setups are created equal! Nor are they suited best for every occasion. Here I show 4 setups I use (or intend to).

I spend quite a bit of time learning the need for a well-established group of setups that incorporates solid strategies to prevent carrying too much unuseful stuff out of home or studio. And during this process, I came across many different kit used by others, some of which I found to be downright scary. You have probably heard of horror stories of people that were hurt carrying gear that they did not use or missing the best of their vacations because they got caught in a "must photograph and film everything" bug.

## The Real Photography Venture (Hardcore)

The purpose of this kit is for a real photography oriented and focused trip, i.e. it's all about the photography trip/vacation. So if you are packing this kind of gear, you expected, planned and studied the locations and all the gear needed. You must be frustrated if you come back and don't use most of what you took, and specially if you did not acomplish what you intended to do.

## The Minimalist Backpack Vacation (Minimalist)

When you want to relax, travel light and eventually register some moments.

Location: Family trip

- [x] Compact camera: [Canon PowerShot G9 X Mark II](https://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/compacts/canon_g9xii)
- [x] Platypod/Gorillapod
- [] Extra batteries and memory cards
- [] Laptop

## The All-Purpose Kit (Light-Medium)

All-rounder kit, should acomplish most needs although you may have to be creative of sorts. You do not expect to focus on photography, but may want to be prepared for some opportunity that may arise.

Location: 

- [x] DSLR
- [x] 24-70mm zoom lens (or combination of 35mm prime and 85mm prime, should packing space allow)
- [x] Wide lens (20mm)
- [x] Platypod or Gorillapod
- [x] Extra batteries and memory cards
- [] Laptop
- [] Drone and power cord

## Minimal with intent (Light-Medium)

Should you have a specific opportunity that poses a compromise of light packing and a need for gear, you should build a specific kit for that location. Face it as a challenge. 

If quality is a priority (i.e. night photography with wide apertures), you will need a DSLR and a specific lens. Then pack the specific lens or the lens that proves to be the most versatile and used for most of the shots that are intended to be captured. Resist the urge to pack a second lens and/or camera body. If-else your cellphone camera must do. Also try to substitute the tripod for the platypod and be creative with mounting it off the ground (try carrying some plastic braces or mounting it over rocktops).

Else, why not give the minimalist kit a try?

1. [x] Compact camera
2. [x] Stabilization device
