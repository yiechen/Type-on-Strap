Here is my wishlist. And I explore why I want, why I need and why I'll buy each of the itens there.

## Macbook Pro 15' 1TB SSD / 32GB RAM / Radeon 560X / i9 - 2.9 GHz

##### Why is it fundamental? How will it be used? For how long it is expected to be of use?

I still need to make life more simple.

I have far too many working computers and storage units. It is now too cumbersome to manage every single project that gets started at one machine and has some progress made in another. I often have to rework what is lost between machines or scrap everything because it would not be worth anymore.

In fact, my computers are not suited for photo or video editing. They are low powered machines with small internal storage. The most troublesome feature is not the low specs on the processing side, but it is the fact that it cannot provide enough storage for all the main applications and the minimum amount of files in a project without running low on memory for the apps to finish a workflow. And given that they have 8 and 4 years of use, I think they accomplished their purpose. 

Right now I am facing a fork on the road. I never really needed a computer with high specs and performance, neither do I now. What is needed at the moment is a honest computer with enought internal storage for some projects when needed. But when you take a medium performance computer and upgrade it's internal storage, the premium that is asked for the extra storage is exorbitant.

So, I would not really mind getting a higher spec model with suficient storage to handle the render of 2-3 hours long videos and source footage, or a time-lapse project encompassing a few thousand photos on raw.

Although I really intend to connect the machine to a proper monitor for most of the heavy work, I am expecting to be able to use it confortably for small tasks, hence the appeal of a 15 inch screen. It should also be noted that the native screen of a MacBook Pro is of high quality, either in terms of resolution and in color reproduction.

To sum up, the prevailing concept is that I want a working powerhouse that is portable and suits video editing. Plus a medium sized screen, it all adds up to a 15 inch Macbook Pro.

I would expect a MacBook Pro of such specs to be of use for no less than 4-5 years to come without any need for better performance. This is expected because the odds of needing better performance are directly related to the odds of photo/video editing becoming my main source of income and work.

##### Why not a Macbook Air

It's not only about the number of ports, for it only has 2 USB-C ports and it imposes too much of a restriction. Also, if you upgrade for a 1-2TB SSD storage unit and 16GB of RAM, it surmounts almost the price of a Macbook Pro of better specs (graphics and main CPU).

All-in-all it just does not present a reasonable value-for-money ratio as it would be underperforming in so many areas. We would be talking at barely the same price for much less performance, fewer connecting ports and sub par screen size and resolution.

##### What about a windows based PC?

No, I do not want to venture again on the troubles of compatibility issues among Apple and other OS devices. It does pay off on the long run to keep all in one integrated plataform of use even if it means paying a hefty premium per device. The higher priced apple notebook is actually the safest investment for personnal satisfaction.

##### What about the butterfly keyboard issues?

Nothing is perfect and all decisions will come to face a harsh reality. It's a well known issue among the community the troubles with the keyboard design and it's failures. It does not affect every single unit sold and it may well be restricted to some kind of pattern of use/user (no scientific proof for that). It is somewhat covered in thw warranty from Apple and it's still worth a bet that I should not be the one to pick the short straw.

It must be noticed that I also intend to tether the laptop to a monitor and use a wireless keyboard when going through major projects or more intense in-home use. This may also lower the odds of debris going inside the fragile mechanism and the normal wear and tear on it's components.

##### Why I should buy

My latest computer is dated november of 2015, a second gen MacBook Air, so it has reached it's half-life and began to present adversities to the simplest of workflows. Even though it is capable of individual photo edition and editing short videos, I have to be certain that it has been stripped down to the bare minimum apps and personal files as a way not to get caught shorthanded with no virtual memory when rendering a file.

Also, I don't think my MacBook Air will face another large software upgrade, MacOS Mojave seems like it's last.

It's safe to say that now is a reasonable point in time to add a new member to the family and, given that the most used machine the last couple of years was actually a 2011 MacMini, the next one if well chosen should be used for many years to come (5+). So it makes sense to splurge more money into a better spec'd Mac today and be happier in the long run as the performance should not drop sharp in the future.

## Platypod Ultra Max

##### Why I want

Low angle shots!

##### Why I need

Small sized, fairly light-weighted, practical.

##### Why I'll buy

Great build quality and great versatility. Overall great cost to benefit ratio. Must need for minimal packing.

## Gorillapod

##### Why I want

Versatility, light weight versus normal tripods.

##### Why I need

To travel lighter.

##### Why I'll buy

Still in doubt. Should buy and store as it may be dificult to find in stock at stores in Brazil.

## [Canon PowerShot G9 X Mark II](https://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/compacts/canon_g9xii)

##### Why I want

Compact camera with RAW files storage capability. Fairly good quality for video and photo.

##### Why I need

May be main camera when travelling light and as reasonable backup/BTS camera in a sturdier setup.

##### Why I'll buy

I can postpone the purchase and see a newer better model should the opportunity arise.

## [SYNOLOGY NAS DS1817+ DISKSTATION (2GB) INTEL ATOM C2538 QUAD CORE 2.4GHZ 2GB DDR3 - TORRE 8 BAIAS - SEM DISCO](https://www.smartmart.com.br/Storage-Synology-NAS-DiskStation-Intel-Atom-C2538-Quad-Core-24GHz-2GB-DDR3-Torre-8-Baias-Sem-Disco-DS1817-2GB)

##### Why I want is why I need

Long-term storage solution. Swappable HDs. RAID capabilities. Synology company success is a warranty if the server breaks down or gets obsolete. 

##### Why I'll buy

Long-term solution is easier to manage and becomes better cost effective than usual external drives. Redundancy is achieved through RAID and internal HDs have better cost to performance ratios. Size and weight prevent from bringing through usual commercial flights. Cost in local currency (BRL) is not prohibitive.
