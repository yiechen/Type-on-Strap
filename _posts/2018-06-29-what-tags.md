The very first thing I had in mind when I started building all this structure about my workflows was that I would have to have a minimal classification system to sort things among themselves.

So the posts here will **only** receive the following tags:

### by kind of post:

- Blog: text-based posts
- Vlog: video only posts
- Photolog: owner's content photography posts
- DataLog: code and data viz oriented posts

### by main theme:

- Code: posts focused on coding, heavy on coding, or how-to this website
- Sports: if post theme is sports
- Technology: if post theme is technology (gadgets and equipment) (not about data viz!)
- Photography: if post theme is photography or videomaking
- Behaviour: if it's about human behaviour, cognition
- Demographics: if it's about economic development, city landscape, urbanism, and correlated themes
- Lifestyle: health, decor, fashion, personal finance
- Travel: all about travelling
- SIREN: my classification method for Movies and Series

### by content:

- Workflow: about my active workflows
- Gear: about gear (my gears or wish lists)
- Tutorial: meta
- Inspiration: inspiring themes either work or life related
- Planning: if travel related, then about itineraries, third party tips, to do lists, et al. Otherwise, work/task related?
- Review: my review of some subject (movie, series, gadget, equipment, other theme?)

I will do my best to abide to only those tags and prevent creating other tags. Note that every post must have *at least two* tags, one for its kind and the other for its theme. Although it should have a tag for content, I am against creating a tag for *rants* or a generic tag for *others*.
