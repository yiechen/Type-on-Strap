The very first thing I had in mind when I started building all this structure about my workflows was that I would have to have a minimal classification system to sort things among themselves.

So the posts here will only receive the following tags with their respective conditions:

### by type of post

- Blog: text-based posts
- Vlog: video only posts
- Photolog: owner's content photography posts
- DataLog: code and data viz oriented posts

### by theme

- Code: posts focused on coding, heavy on coding, or how-to this website
- Sports: if post theme is sports
- Technology: if post theme is technology (gadgets and equipment) (not about data viz!)
- Photography: if post theme is photography or videomaking
- Behaviour: if it's about human behaviour, cognition
- Demographics: if it's about economic development, city landscape, urbanism, and correlated themes
- Travel: all about travelling

### by content

- Workflow: about my active workflows
- Tips: meta
- Inspiration: inspiring themes work related or live related
- Planning: itineraries, third party tips, to do lists, et al
