Here is my wishlist. And I explore why I want, why I need and why I'll buy each of the itens there.

## Macbook Pro 15' 2TB SSD

##### Why I want is why I need

I urge for making my life more simple. I have far too many working computers and storage units. It is now too cumbersome to manage every single project that gets started at one machine and it's progress is made in another. Often I have to redo some of the work that is lost between machines or I have to scrap everything because time has passed...

Add all that to the restraints in local storage on my working computers now and the low specs on them for photo and video editing. And working full-time in a laptop calls for a bigger screen.

The prevailing concept is that I want a working powerhouse that is portable and suits video editing. Plus a medium sized screen, it all adds up to a 15 inch Macbook Pro.

##### Why not a Macbook Air

It all about the number of ports... only 2 USB-C ports is too much of a restriction. Also, if you upgrade for a 2TB SSD storage unit and 16GB of RAM, it surmounts almost the price of a Macbook Pro of better specs (graphics card and main CPU).

##### Why I'll buy

My latest computer is dated november of 2015, a second gen Macbook Air, so it has reached it's half-life and is approaching dangerously the end of it's productive life. I don't think it will see another large software upgrade, Macos Mojave is most probably it's last.

It's safe to say that it is a reasonable point in time to add a new member to the family and, given that the most used machine the last couple of years was actually a 2011 MacMini, the next one if well chosen will be used for many years to come (5+). So it makes sense to splurge more money into a better spec'd Mac today and be happier in the long run as the performance should not drop so sharply in the future.

## Platypod Ultra Max

##### Why I want

Low angle shots!

##### Why I need

Small sized, fairly light-weighted, practical.

##### Why I'll buy

Great build quality and great versatility. Overall great cost to benefit ratio. Must need for minimal packing.

## Gorillapod

##### Why I want

Versatility, light weight versus normal tripods.

##### Why I need

To travel lighter.

##### Why I'll buy

Still in doubt. Should buy and store as it may be dificult to find in stock at stores in Brazil.

## [Canon PowerShot G9 X Mark II](https://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/compacts/canon_g9xii)

##### Why I want

Compact camera with RAW files storage capability. Fairly good quality for video and photo.

##### Why I need

May be main camera when travelling light and as reasonable backup/BTS camera in a sturdier setup.

##### Why I'll buy

I can postpone the purchase and see a newer better model should the opportunity arise.

## [SYNOLOGY NAS DS1817+ DISKSTATION (2GB) INTEL ATOM C2538 QUAD CORE 2.4GHZ 2GB DDR3 - TORRE 8 BAIAS - SEM DISCO](https://www.smartmart.com.br/Storage-Synology-NAS-DiskStation-Intel-Atom-C2538-Quad-Core-24GHz-2GB-DDR3-Torre-8-Baias-Sem-Disco-DS1817-2GB)

##### Why I want is why I need

Long-term storage solution. Swappable HDs. RAID capabilities. Synology company success is a warranty if the server breaks down or gets obsolete. 

##### Why I'll buy

Long-term solution is easier to manage and becomes better cost effective than usual external drives. Redundancy is achieved through RAID and internal HDs have better cost to performance ratios. Size and weight prevent from bringing through usual commercial flights. Cost in local currency (BRL) is not prohibitive.
